Previously, I studied neuroscience (specifically serotonin neurons) in Susan Dymeckiâ€™s lab at Harvard University for my PhD.\nSince my PhD, Iâ€™ve transitioned from being a wet lab bench scientist to fully computational. I greatly enjoy being a link between these two worlds. Today, I use my biology background to help distill complex computational workflows and concepts to information that is salient and useful for biologists.\nThis blog is a collection of resources Iâ€™ve made or contributed to as well as a place to house my resume/CV ðŸ“„ and data visualization portfolio ðŸ“Š. I particularly like to make data visualizations about video games ðŸŽ® as playing games is a major hobby of mine."
